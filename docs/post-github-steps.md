# Post-GitHub Steps — Ready for Submission

After the code is on GitHub, follow these steps to complete the hackathon submission.

---

## 1. Bright Data (Optional Bonus)

To enable the "Official Live Context" section in What's Happening Nearby:

1. **Get API key** from [Bright Data](https://brightdata.com/cp/setting/users)
2. **Create SERP zone** at [Bright Data Zones](https://brightdata.com/cp/zones) (use `serp_api`)
3. **Set environment variable:**
   - `BRIGHTDATA_API_KEY` = your API key
   - Optional: `BRIGHT_DATA_SERP_ZONE` = your zone ID (default: `serp_api`)
4. **Enable in code:** Set `BRIGHT_DATA_ENABLED = true` in `src/config/feature-flags.ts`
5. **Deploy:** Bright Data works server-side; the Vercel API route (`api/official-live-context.ts`) needs the env var in Vercel's dashboard

See `docs/bright-data-scaffold.md` for full details.

## 2. GitHub Pages (Alternative to Vercel)

You can also deploy to GitHub Pages for a free static host:

1. **Settings** → **Pages** → **Source:** **GitHub Actions**
2. Push to `main` — the workflow builds and deploys automatically
3. URL: `https://abarcof.github.io/my-address-my-city/`

See `docs/github-pages-setup.md` for details. **Note:** Bright Data API will not work on GitHub Pages; use Vercel for that.

## 3. Vercel Deployment (Prototype URL)

To get the working prototype URL for the submission form:

1. Go to [vercel.com](https://vercel.com) and sign in with GitHub
2. Click **Add New Project** → **Import** your `my-address-my-city` repo
3. Vercel auto-detects Vite — keep default settings:
   - Build Command: `npm run build`
   - Output Directory: `dist`
   - Root Directory: (leave empty)
4. **Environment variables** (if using Bright Data): Add `BRIGHTDATA_API_KEY` in Project Settings → Environment Variables
5. Click **Deploy**
6. When done, copy the URL (e.g. `https://my-address-my-city-xxxx.vercel.app`) — this is your **working prototype URL**
